# The printer side: Moonraker as the only device

KLIPSLICE talks to a printer through Moonraker and nothing else. There is no device model of
the printer inside the app, no agent that mirrors its state, and no vendor protocol. Three
pieces touch the printer, each with one job.

## The Device tab

`PrinterWebView` (`src/slic3r/GUI/PrinterWebView.*`) is the Device tab, registered under
`TAB_ID_MONITOR`. It is a browser showing the printer's own web UI, Mainsail or Fluidd, at the
URL `PrintHost::get_print_host_webui` derives from the printer preset: `print_host_webui` when
set, else `print_host`, with `http://` added when the user typed no scheme. The preset's
`printhost_apikey` is injected into the page's `fetch` calls. With no host configured the tab
shows `resources/web/orca/missing_connection.html`. `MainFrame::show_device()` only ensures the
page is in the notebook; `load_printer_url` reloads it when the printer preset changes.

Above the browser sits `PrinterStatusStrip`, one line with the link state, what the printer is
doing and its temperatures. It is fed by `MoonrakerStatus` (`src/slic3r/Utils/MoonrakerStatus.*`),
which polls `GET /printer/objects/query?webhooks&print_stats&display_status&virtual_sdcard&extruder&heater_bed`
on a background thread every 2 s while the printer answers and every 5 s while it does not,
and reports only changes. The poll runs for as long as the tab exists and
`PrinterWebView::restart_status()` restarts it for the edited printer preset whenever the URL is
reloaded; a poll in flight is cancelled through the transfer's progress callback, so a restart
never waits for a timeout. The parser (`MoonrakerStatusParser::apply`) is a pure function over the reply and is
covered by `tests/slic3rutils/test_moonraker_status.cpp`. Everything richer than this line, from
temperature targets to macros, is the web UI's job; the strip exists so the slicer shows the
printer's state without switching tabs.

## Printing

Print and Send upload through the print host (`src/slic3r/Utils/Moonraker.cpp`): the Plater's
`send_gcode_legacy` opens `PrintHostSendDialog`, the background process post-processes the
G-code and `PrintHostJobQueue` performs `POST /server/files/upload` followed by
`POST /printer/print/start` when the user asked to print. `PrintHost::get_print_host` returns
a `Moonraker` for every FFF preset; `host_type` has no other value. On Windows a `.local` host
name is resolved once through mDNS and the address reused for the whole upload, since two
resolves in a row fail there. Moonraker instances on the LAN are found by their
`_moonraker._tcp` Bonjour announcement in the physical printer dialog.

## Filament sync

The sidebar's sync button reads the filament changer through `MoonrakerFilaments`
(`src/slic3r/Utils/MoonrakerFilaments.*`), probing in this order: Moonraker's `lane_data`
database namespace (AFC, recent Happy Hare), Happy Hare's `mmu` printer object, a Qidi box
(`save_variables` slot variables plus `box_stepper slotN` runout sensors and the box's
`officiall_filas_list.cfg`), and a Snapmaker toolhead (`print_task_config` with the NFC data
of `filament_detect`). The changer family is picked from `/printer/objects/list`, so no profile
key names it. Every loaded slot is resolved to a preset `filament_id` (vendor and closest
colour first, then a visible system base preset of the material, else `UNKNOWN_FILAMENT_ID`),
and `Sidebar::build_filament_ams_list` maps the slots one to one onto
`PresetBundle::filament_ams_list` with `T<n>` as the tray name and placeholders for empty
slots, which `PresetBundle::sync_ams_list` then applies directly. The parsers are pure
functions over recorded replies, tested in `tests/slic3rutils/test_moonraker_filaments.cpp`.

## What this rules out

Nozzle counts, extruder layout and bed types come from the printer preset, never from the
machine. Calibrations run from the Calibration menu as ordinary prints. The Python plugin
system keeps its cloud and slicing capabilities; a `printer-connection` capability has no host
side and is not instantiated. `NetworkAgent` is the Orca cloud only.
