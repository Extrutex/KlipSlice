# Virtual printer rig

An end-to-end check that G-code produced by KLIPSLICE is accepted by real,
unmodified upstream Klipper and Moonraker. It runs entirely in local Docker
containers on an internal network with no published ports: no real printer is
contacted, and nothing on the LAN can reach the rig.

```sh
tests/virtual-printer/run.sh
```

One command runs all three steps and exits non-zero if any fails. Results go
to `tests/virtual-printer/out/` (gitignored): `report.md`, the G-code, JSON
results and all logs.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `KLIPSLICE_BIN` | Slicer binary. Default: `build/arm64/OrcaSlicer/KLIPSLICE.app/Contents/MacOS/KLIPSLICE` on macOS, `build/package/bin/klipslice` on Linux. An extracted AppImage's `AppRun` works too. |
| `VP_KEEP_RIG=1` | Leave the Klipper and Moonraker containers running for manual inspection (`docker compose -p klipslice-vp ...`). |

Requirements: Docker with Compose v2, bash, and a KLIPSLICE build. The image
is about 450 MB and each container is limited to 512 MB of RAM. The first run
builds the image from GitHub sources (about a minute); later runs reuse it and
take about 30 seconds.

## What runs

1. **Slice.** The KLIPSLICE CLI slices `tests/data/20mm_cube.obj` with the
   shipped `Voron 2.4 350 0.4 nozzle`, `0.20mm Standard @Voron` and
   `Generic PLA @System` presets.
2. **Klipper batch mode.** `klippy.py printer.cfg -i <gcode> -o /dev/null -d <dict>`,
   upstream's own batch mode, executes every command of the file against
   `printer.cfg`: kinematics, travel limits, macros, extrusion limits,
   exclude_object. The data dictionary comes from building Klipper for its
   Linux host-MCU target inside the image.
3. **Moonraker.** A long-running Klippy with the same file-output MCU and its
   API socket open, and Moonraker connected to it. The check uploads the file
   (`/server/files/upload`), reads `/server/files/metadata`, starts the print
   (`/printer/print/start`) and follows it to the end. Because the MCU is a
   file, the print runs at CPU speed: a 9-minute cube finishes in a few seconds.

### Pass criteria

- Klipper: klippy exits 0, no G-code error, no ERROR log record, no
  `Unknown command`.
- Moonraker: Klippy ready; upload accepted; metadata has a slicer and a non-zero
  `estimated_time`; `exclude_object.objects` during the print equals the
  file's `EXCLUDE_OBJECT_DEFINE` names; `print_stats` ends `complete`; no
  error or unknown-command response in the G-code store during the print.

### Reported, not failed

- WARNING log records from Klippy.
- **Deprecated parameters**: parameters Klipper still accepts but has
  deprecated (a fixed list in `klippy_batch.py`, kept in step with the pinned
  Klipper's `docs/Config_Changes.md`). Klipper logs nothing for these.
- **Ignored parameters**: parameters given on a command line that Klipper's
  handler never read, e.g. `M73 R`. Found by observing the handlers (below),
  not from a list.
- Klipper's own motion time for the printed part, and the first-layer time,
  next to the slicer's estimates.
- Moonraker metadata fields, thumbnails, `print_stats.info`, Klipper config
  warnings. Every API response is kept in `out/moonraker.json`.

## How the parts fit

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | One image for all three containers: pinned Klipper (host-MCU dictionary, Klippy venv, prebuilt C helper) and pinned Moonraker. Tags are checked against their commit hashes. |
| `klippy-constraints.txt`, `moonraker-constraints.txt` | Exact versions of every Python package, transitive ones included. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | `klipper-batch` (one-shot), `klipper` and `moonraker` (long-running). Internal network, no ports, containers run as the invoking user. |
| `printer.cfg` | Virtual Voron 2.4 350: CoreXY, four Z motors with quad gantry level, probe, input shaper (MZV 58.0/42.4 Hz), firmware retraction, arcs, exclude_object, virtual_sdcard, pause_resume, display_status. `PRINT_START`/`PRINT_END`/`CANCEL_PRINT` stub macros. |
| `moonraker.conf` | Loopback only, loopback is the only trusted client, no CORS, no system service provider. |
| `klippy_batch.py` | Runs `klippy.main()` in-process and observes it: log records with levels, which parameters each command handler read, toolhead print time. Klipper's code is not changed. |
| `check_moonraker.py` | The Moonraker API steps, run inside the moonraker container against `127.0.0.1:7125`. |
| `report.py` | Writes `out/report.md`. |
| `run.sh` | Drives everything. |

### Why file output instead of a simulated MCU

Klippy's batch mode replaces the MCU with a file: it encodes every MCU command
from the data dictionary and writes it out, and treats the clock as already
synchronised. Everything above the MCU is upstream code doing its normal work:
config parsing, G-code dispatch, macros, the toolhead and lookahead,
kinematics, step compression, exclude_object, virtual_sdcard, the API server.
For the Moonraker step Klippy runs the same way, with input through its API
instead of a file. (With an input file Klippy disables its API server.)

What this does not exercise:

- MCU responses. Endstops and the probe report the configured trigger
  position, heaters reach their target at once (`M109`/`M190` return
  immediately), and TMC drivers cannot be configured because their register
  reads need an answering MCU, so `printer.cfg` has none.
- Real time. Prints run at CPU speed. Time-based values from the live print
  are not physical: `print_stats.print_duration` is seconds of CPU time, and
  `print_stats.filament_used` misses the extrusion after Moonraker's last
  status poll because Klipper only accumulates it when status is read.
- One error ends the batch run, by Klipper's design: in batch mode a G-code
  error exits Klippy, so only the first error of a file is reported.

A simulated AVR (simulavr) or a Linux host-MCU process would answer MCU
queries, but simulavr's AVR targets lack the pins for seven steppers plus
heaters and fans, the host-MCU process needs real GPIO character devices, and
both run in real time. For a check of the G-code, the file-output MCU is the
right level.

## Updating the pinned versions

1. Set `KLIPPER_TAG`/`KLIPPER_COMMIT` or `MOONRAKER_TAG`/`MOONRAKER_COMMIT` in
   the `Dockerfile` (`git ls-remote --tags <repo>` shows both; for an annotated
   tag, take the `^{}` commit).
2. Regenerate the constraints file from a fresh build of the new requirements,
   e.g. remove the `-c` option once, build, and write
   `docker run --rm klipslice-vp:local /opt/<klippy|moonraker>-env/bin/pip freeze`
   back into the file.
3. Review `DEPRECATED_PARAMS` in `klippy_batch.py` against the new Klipper's
   `docs/Config_Changes.md`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/virtual_printer.yml` runs the rig on `ubuntu-24.04` after
every successful "Build all" run triggered by a push to `dev`, and on demand
(`workflow_dispatch`, optionally with the ID of a "Build all" run). It builds
nothing heavy: it downloads that run's Linux x86_64 AppImage artifact, extracts
it, and runs `run.sh` with `KLIPSLICE_BIN` pointing at its `AppRun`. The report
is added to the job summary and `out/` is uploaded as an artifact.
`workflow_run` triggers only fire for workflow files on the default branch.
